# Book Library

The application is a "library" of book titles that hold information
about the book which include the title, page count, and author.
The author of the book can be viewed to see their date of birth
and a wikipedia link about them or the title they created. The
applicatioin allows the user to login via google and use full
CRUD on the book data, once logged in.
